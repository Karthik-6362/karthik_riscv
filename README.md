BASIC LOGIC GATES :-

This can be used in sequence to get a n-bit adder.

BOOLEAN OPERATORS IN VERILOG :-

MULTIPLEXER(MUX) :- 
A simple multiplexer (mux) is a digital logic device with multiple data inputs, one output, and a set of control inputs. It selects one of the data inputs to be transmitted to the output based on the binary values present on the control inputs. The selected input is then forwarded to the output, effectively allowing data from a single source to be sent to the output.

``` verilog
Syntax:- condition ? expression_if_true : expression_if_false
assign f = s ? X1 : X2;   // using a ternary operator
```

The code `assign f = s ? X1 : X2;` represents a one-line Verilog description of a multiplexer (mux) operation, where the output `f` is assigned the value of `X1` when the select signal `s` is true, and the value of `X2` when the select signal is false. 

CHAINING TERNARY OPERATOR:-
